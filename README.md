# it240-project

# TaoWater Gallery

This project was finished at it240 class during Fall 2017.

The requirement was updating existing website that the owner has at the moment.

We were working in team and only asked to use HTML/CSS3 to develop the project.

However, we could've used some javascript if we capable of using it. which we did use some Javascript to develop a showcase pop-up and be able to slide through the art pieces one by one.
