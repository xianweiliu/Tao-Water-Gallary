# it240-project

# TaoWater Gallery

This project was finished at it240 class during Fall 2017.

The requirement was update existing website.

Working in team and only asked to use HTML/CSS3 for developing the project, therefore the majority of the project is based on HTML/CSS.

Used some Javascript to develop a showcase and be able to slide through each of the art pieces one by one.

All the sources were provided by the owner, [TaoWater Gallery](http://www.taowatergallery.com/).
